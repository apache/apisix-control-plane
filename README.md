# apisix-control-plane

## what is apisix-control-plane?
apisix-control-plane provide APISIX with a `yaml` configuration capability,
We can use `yaml` to define the proxy behavior of APISIX

## Why do you want to do this?
1. In order to facilitate the integration of k8s, use `yaml` to define APISIX;
2. For easier synchronization across clusters;
3. Can be better adapted to multiple platforms (k8s, vm);

## DISCUSS
Here are some examples of `yaml` and we can add comments here.
https://github.com/apache/apisix-control-plane/issues/3
We can also submit a PR to modify this [document](doc/yaml_struct.md).
